Run CMD to check/delete the AWS Face Rekognition Data.

1. Check the Rekognition Collection
AWS Rekognition stores indexed faces in a Collection. If the same face is being detected as a duplicate, it means the face is already in the collection.

Steps to List Indexed Faces in a Collection
Use AWS CLI: Run the following command to list all faces in the collection:

**RUN CMD:**
aws rekognition list-faces --collection-id user_faces --region us-east-1

Replace user_faces with your collection ID.
This command will show the list of face IDs and their associated metadata.
Inspect Results: Look at the FaceId or ExternalImageId values to see if the face has already been indexed.

2. Delete Faces from the Collection
If you no longer need the face in the collection, you can delete it.

Steps to Delete a Face
Use AWS CLI:

- To delete a specific face, run:

**RUN CMD:**
aws rekognition delete-faces --collection-id user_faces --face-ids "FACE_ID" --region us-east-1

Replace FACE_ID with the actual Face ID from the list-faces result.

- To delete multiple faces:

**RUN CMD:**
aws rekognition delete-faces --collection-id user_faces --face-ids "FACE_ID1" "FACE_ID2" --region us-east-1

Clear Entire Collection (Optional): If you want to start fresh, you can delete and recreate the collection:

**RUN CMD:**
aws rekognition delete-collection --collection-id user_faces --region us-east-1
aws rekognition create-collection --collection-id user_faces --region us-east-1
